This is the mandelbrot set.
The graph of whether a number with real and imaginary parts 
(x axis is real part, y axis is imaginary part)
will spiral off into infinity when put into the recursive equation:
n = nÂ² + c

The dark will not, the light will, the boundaries are on the edge,
this is where the magic happens.
Zoom in to watch the infinite complexity of apparent simplicity.

Click to zoom, shift click to zoom out, 
pan around with the grey buttons on the borders.
If it's too slow lower the resolution.
If the screen gets too dark increase calculations (per point)
and find the hidden detail.
